## Active Task Details

### OTP001: Implement TaskWorker GenServer

**Description**
Create a robust GenServer-based worker that processes tasks with proper state management, error handling, and telemetry integration.

**GenServer Design**
Core GenServer implementation following OTP patterns:
- State management for task processing with immutable updates
- handle_call/3 for synchronous task assignment and status queries
- handle_cast/2 for asynchronous task updates and cancellation
- handle_info/2 for timeout handling and external messages
- terminate/2 for graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

**Process Architecture**
Single-responsibility GenServer with clear boundaries:
- Task processing logic isolated in pure functions
- State transitions tracked with telemetry events
- Backoff strategy for failed task retries
- Memory usage monitoring with automatic restart thresholds

**Supervision Strategy**
Permanent restart strategy with exponential backoff:
- Restart intensity: max 3 restarts in 60 seconds
- Escalate to supervisor after repeated failures
- Child specification with proper shutdown timeouts
- Resource cleanup on process termination

**Requirements**
- Concurrent task processing with configurable worker pool
- Task timeout handling with graceful cancellation
- Memory-safe processing with automatic garbage collection
- Telemetry metrics for performance monitoring
- Structured logging for debugging and observability

- State management and transition tests
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Timeout and cancellation behavior verification

**Integration Test Scenarios**
- Worker pool scaling under load
- Task processing with varying execution times
- Error recovery and supervisor escalation
- Memory usage patterns and cleanup verification

**Typespec Requirements**
- GenServer state type definitions
- Task processing callback specifications  
- Error tuple type definitions for consistent error handling

**TypeSpec Documentation**
Clear documentation of GenServer callbacks, state transitions, and error patterns

## #{{otp-error-handling}}
**Error Handling**
**OTP Principles**
- Let it crash with supervisor restart
- Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason} for client functions
- Handle_call/3 returns for synchronous operations
- Process isolation prevents cascading failures

**GenServer Error Patterns**
- Handle_call/3: Return {:reply, {:error, reason}, state}
- Handle_cast/2: Log error and continue with updated state
- Handle_info/2: Pattern match expected messages, ignore unknown
- Terminate/2: Clean up resources, don't crash during cleanup

**Supervision Strategies**
- One-for-one: Restart only failed process
- One-for-all: Restart all children if one fails
- Rest-for-one: Restart failed process and those started after it
- Dynamic: Add/remove children at runtime

**Error Examples**
- Client timeout: {:error, :timeout}
- Invalid state: {:error, :invalid_state}
- Resource exhaustion: {:error, :resource_limit}
