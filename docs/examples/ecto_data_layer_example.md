## #{{ecto-error-handling}}
**Error Handling**
**Ecto Principles**
- Use changesets for validation errors
- Handle constraint violations gracefully
- Use Multi for transactional operations
- Pattern match on {:ok, result} | {:error, changeset}

**Migration Safety**
- Always test rollback procedures
- Handle data integrity during migrations
- Use constraints instead of validations where possible
- Create indexes concurrently in production

**Query Error Patterns**
- Not found: {:error, :not_found}
- Validation: {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}}
- Constraint: {:error, :constraint_violation}
- Transaction: {:error, :transaction_failed}

**Error Examples**
- Changeset validation: {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{valid?: false}}
- Unique constraint: {:error, :email_already_taken}
- Foreign key constraint: {:error, :invalid_reference}
