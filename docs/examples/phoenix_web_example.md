## Active Task Details

### PHX101: Implement user authentication LiveView

**Description**
Create a comprehensive authentication system using Phoenix LiveView with real-time validation, secure session management, and intuitive user experience.

**Route Design**
RESTful authentication routes with proper HTTP verbs and Phoenix path helpers:
- GET /register - User registration form
- POST /register - Create new user account  
- GET /login - User login form
- POST /login - Authenticate user session
- DELETE /logout - Destroy user session
- GET /profile - User profile management

**Context Integration**
Clean integration with Accounts context following Phoenix domain boundaries:
- Accounts.create_user/1 for user registration
- Accounts.authenticate_user/2 for login validation
- Accounts.get_user_by_session_token/1 for session management
- Minimal coupling between web layer and business logic

**Template/Component Strategy**
LiveView-based authentication with reusable components:
- AuthLive.Register - Registration form with real-time validation
- AuthLive.Login - Login form with error handling
- Components.UserNav - Navigation component with session state
- Form components for consistent styling and validation

**Simplicity Progression Plan**
1. Design route structure and controller actions
2. Implement basic LiveView authentication forms
3. Add real-time validation and error feedback
4. Integrate with Accounts context and session management
5. Style components and add UX enhancements

**Requirements**
- LiveView authentication forms with real-time validation
- Secure session management with Phoenix.Token
- Password hashing with Argon2
- Email verification workflow
- Remember me functionality
- Rate limiting for login attempts

**ExUnit Test Requirements**

- Authentication flow integration tests  
- Form validation and error display tests
- Session management and security tests

**Integration Test Scenarios**
- Complete user registration workflow
- Login with valid/invalid credentials
- Session persistence and expiration
- Concurrent session management
- Password reset functionality

**Typespec Requirements**
- LiveView assign types for authentication state
- Event specifications for form handling
- Session data type definitions

**TypeSpec Documentation**
Clear documentation of LiveView authentication patterns and session contracts

**TypeSpec Verification**
Dialyzer verification of LiveView callbacks and authentication types

## #{{phoenix-error-handling}}
**Error Handling**
**Core Principles**
- Pass raw errors
- Use {:ok, result} | {:error, reason}
- Let it crash
**Error Implementation**
- No wrapping
- Minimal rescue
- function/1 & /! versions
**Error Examples**
- Raw error passthrough
- Simple rescue case
- Supervisor handling
**GenServer Specifics**
- Handle_call/3 error pattern
- Terminate/2 proper usage
- Process linking considerations
**Phoenix Principles**
- Use pattern matching for expected errors
- Let LiveView crash and restart for unexpected errors
- Handle user input validation at LiveView boundary
- Use Phoenix.LiveView.put_flash for user feedback
**LiveView Error Patterns**
- Mount errors: Redirect to fallback page
- Event errors: Display inline validation messages
- Socket errors: Graceful degradation to HTTP fallback
- Process linking: Minimal process dependencies
